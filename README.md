Privacy Policy

BookCatalog is a free service. Users are not required to pay any fees to install and use the Application. 
However the Application requires Internet Connection to retrieve Book information from the Internet. 
Data charges may apply and these are solely the user's responsibility. 
I will not be liable or held accountable for this.

BOOK DATA

BookCatalog saves book data on your device. I have no access to this data. 
This is done to improve the performance of the Application and help you access it quickly. 
Generally the amount of data that the Application saves on users devices is very small. 
This is done for security and performance purposes.
Users may add their preferred books on their Wishlists and are restricted to only hundred (100) books.
This should be done securely and responsibly by checking the amount of space available on their devices as the data will be stored on their devices. 
I will not not be held accountable for any inappropriate use of this functionality. 


Please use this feature responsibly because I believe this feature empowers you to create your favourite collection of books and get much deeper insights of them by reading their descriptions offline.


CAMERA

I continuously seek to improve user experience on BookCatalog by adding features that users find helpful. 
Camera feature is one such feature that I believe users will find particularly helpful and useful. 
It's main purpose on BookCatalog is to help users take photos or pictures of any Book that they happened to come across and find particularly interesting and search for it later on BookCatalog. 
I believe Camera feature is a very essential component of BookCatalog and can enhance the overall User Experience.
However users are not limited to taking pictures of Books with this Camera, they can use it to capture their favourite moments and share them with family and friends. 

They should however do so responsibly.

I believe BookCatalog users will use this feature responsibly.
I will not take responsibility for any inappropriate use of this feature. 
As I have already stated above, it's main purpose is to take pictures of Books and search for them later on BookCatalog.
